## Embedbase

Embedbase is an open-source API to compute ML embeddings. This SDK makes it easy to use Embedbase in your app.


Before you start, you need get a an API key at [embedbase.xyz](https://embedbase.xyz).

*Note: we're working on a fully client-side SDK. In the meantime, you can use the hosted instance of Embedbase.*


```
npm i embedbase-js
```

## Why Embedbase

Embeddings are a powerful way to represent data. They can be used to create recommendation engines, search engines, and Q&A engines. Embedbase gives you and sdk & an api to create these systems without any ML knowledge.

Embedbase is fully open-source and is designed to accompany you from your first line of code to shipping your apps to millions of users.

## What is it

This is the official typescript client for Embedbase. Embedbase is an open-source API to manage ML embeddings.

## Who is it for

- App developers who want to add ML to their apps without having to worry about the infrastructure
- ML engineers who want to prototype classification systems

## Installation

You can install embedbase-js via the terminal.

```
npm i embedbase-js
```

### Initializing

```ts
import { createClient } from 'embedbase-js'

// you can find the api key at https://embedbase.xyz
const apiKey = 'your api key'
// this is using the hosted instance
const url = 'https://api.embedbase.xyz'

const embedbase = createClient(url, apiKey)
```

### Searching datasets

```ts
// fetching data
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('amazon-reviews')
  .search('best hot dogs accessories', { limit: 3 })

console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.810843349,
//       "data": "The world is going to smell very different once electric      vehicles become commonplace"
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.794602573,
//       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass"
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.792932034,
//       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth"
//   },
// ]
```

### Adding Data

```js
const data =
  await // embeddings are extremely good for retrieving unstructured data
  // in this example we store an unparsable html string
  embedbase.dataset('amazon-reviews').add(`
  <div>
    <span>Lightweight. Telescopic. Easy zipper case for storage. Didn't put in dishwasher. Still perfect after many uses.</span>
`)

console.log(data)
//
// {
//   "id": "eiew823",
//   "data": "Lightweight. Telescopic. Easy zipper case for storage.
//          Didn't put in dishwasher. Still perfect after many uses."
//     }
// }
```

### Creating a "context"

`createContext` is very similar to `.search` but it returns strings instead of an object. This is useful if you want to easily feed it to GPT.

```js
// you can create a context to store data
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('my-documentation')
  .createContext('my-context')

console.log(data)
[
 "Embedbase API allows to store unstructured data...",
 "Embedbase API has 3 main functions a) provides a plug and play solution to store embeddings b) makes it easy to connect to get the right data into llms c)..",
 "Embedabase API is self-hostable...",

]
```
